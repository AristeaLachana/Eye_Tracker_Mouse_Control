# Eye_Tracker_Mouse_Control script

This script controls cursor movement and click, using the Tobii Pro Fusion eye tracker (it might be compatible with other eye trackers too). 

This is a *Python* script, that is part of our thesis (game development - 2D/3D games, using an eye tracker).


# Get Started

- Calibrate your eye tracker. 

- Start the script. 

- The mouse cursor follows left eye movements on the screen. 

# Click

To perform **single-click**, just stare for a moment at any element on the screen that you want to click.
